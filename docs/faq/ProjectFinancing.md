    We have a global platform for peer to peer trade and finance. We will be inviting leading project feasibility evaluators to be on the platform. The financiers may evaluate and shortlist one of them to carry out techno-commercial feasibility, if they need. This will help them take an informed decision on investing in a project based on the risk appetite. For larger projects, government security will be sought.
