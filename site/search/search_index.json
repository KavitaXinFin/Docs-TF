Majority of this trade is driven by global infrastructure development due to increased population and urbanization. As per Global infrastructure hub 2017 report, by 2040, the global population will grow by almost 2 Billion people a 25% increase. Also, rural to urban migration will skew this growth more towards urban areas leading to an urban population growing by 46 USD. This will trigger massive demand for infrastructure support, especially in an urban area and to keep pace with this growth, the global infrastructure investment needs are forecasted to reach 94 USD Trillion by 2040, which is an average of 3.7 USD Trillion per year. Based on current spending levels, the shortfall is more than 18 USD Trillion which is around a Trillion dollar gap every year. To fuel this massive infrastructure growth, financial institutions and banks are supposed to pump money into the ecosystem. However, decreasing trust factor and increasing risk have made it difficult for businesses and individuals to access trade finance or they are denied trade finance due to increased regulatory and compliance limitations of traditional financing system. Of the global financing needs today, infrastructure remains the most sizeable and critical financing need for both developed as well as developing countries. And, even after being pivotal to any country\u2019s social-economic progress, infrastructure financing still remains underserved. Why? Financing sector suffers from a lot of inefficiencies. Infrastructure financing being the most unglamorous industry receives very less support from the private sector leading to an increasing tax burden on govt. and consequently on the general public. Inefficient, time-consuming and paper-based financing further adds to the cost of capital. Even finance rates vary a lot worldwide and presence of intermediaries makes centralized funds inaccessible to people. Therefore, the present financial ecosystem is incapable of fulfilling the burgeoning financing demand, leading to huge loss of opportunity for global trade and in turn, economic development which requires a disruptive technology like blockchain to innovate financing mechanism to complement traditional banking and finance. A word about TradeFinex.org Powered by XDC protocol, TradeFinex platform enables peer-to-peer transactions between financiers, suppliers and beneficiaries.

The use of XinFin's XDC fueled tokenization scheme, permits trade and financing to be truly global in nature eliminating the funding gap owing to disparate currencies spread across the world. Moreover, investors in developed countries are averse to financing underdeveloped countries due to high currency depreciation risk, but with XinFin's common world token it makes it easier for them to lend money providing more stability and confidence to any cross border investment or debt.

Smart contracts are self-executing, legally binding contracts with agreement terms between different parties like buyer and supplier, buyer and financier, financier and supplier respectively, written into lines of code. These codes and agreements constituted therein; are present across a distributed, decentralized, and secure blockchain network. Smart contracts enable trusted transactions & agreements to be performed among different, anonymous parties without any need of a central authority, legitimate system, or external implementation mechanism. Therefore, these kinds of contracts ensure transparent, traceable, and irreversible transactions. What are the benefits of smart contracts? The benefits of smart contracts include: Autonomy: Since the participants are the one making the contract, the need to have an intermediary, broker or lawyer is crossed out. Therefore, the participants enjoy complete authority over the agreement without any manipulations from third party. Trust-Since all of the participants' documents are encrypted and put on a shared ledger, all the unreal excuses of their documents being lost are automatically ruled out. Backup-Since all the participants' documents are duplicated many times over TradeFinex blockchain, they always enjoy free backup. Safety-Cryptography (the technology of encrypting websites) ensures TradeFinex is never hacked and therefore, participants are safe in every aspect. Speed-Since smart contracts deploy a software code to automate tasks, participants save hours of time that would otherwise go towards manually processing all paperwork. Savings-Since there is no intermediary or third party, participants save big on fees paid to notary and more. curacy-Since everything is done digitally, the possibility of human error is automatically ruled out, hence the accuracy. Will the smart contracts be legally binding? Smart contracts or blockchain contracts or digital contracts over TradeFinex platform create and enforce an agreed upon performance between two parties, much like their traditional counterpart. The only difference being the smart contracts that are computer-generated and it is the code itself that explains the obligations of the parties. In many cases, the parties to a smart contract are essentially strangers on the internet bound by the digitally-produced but binding agreement. Hence, the smart contracts over TradeFinex blockchain will be legally binding. How to create a legally binding contract? After the parties have negotiated techno-commercial specifications of the contract, the Financier/Supplier can initiate a digital Smart Contract. Under this contract, the initiator can add scope of the work, Payment terms and milestones, release conditions along with other party by digitally submitting the contract. The other party can view the contract, edit and modify the terms and send it back to the initiator. Upon reaching an agreement, each party using their cryptographic key, unique to them can sign off on the contract. The cryptographic key would be either a \"symbol or process attached to or logically linked with a record\" and the deliberate signing off will demonstrate each party's \"intent to sign the record\". Irrespective of the specific contract terms between the parties, the fact that a blockchain-based smart contract can require the participants to sign the contract through the cryptographic key should ensure them that smart contracts created over TradeFinex blockchain are legally binding contracts.
